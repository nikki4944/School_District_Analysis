# School District Analysis
Module 4 Challenge

## Project Overview

The client, a district school board, has requested an analysis of standardized test scores for all of the schools in the district which will they will use to determine who they allocate funds in the next year's budget. For this analysis, the data consists of math and reading scores for all grade levels (9th-12th) from the 15 schools (both charter and district) which make up the district.

The data was analyzed to find the each school's average math and reading score as well as the passing percentage of each and the overall passing percentage. The data was futher filtered to provide results for each of the four grade levels, size of student population, amount of budget spend per student, and the type of school (district vs. charter).

After performing an analysis, school board reported a potential problem with the data reported for 9th graders at Thomas High School. Another analysis was performed which removed these scores from the final deliverable.
